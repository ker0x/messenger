Write a short README entry for your feature/bugfix here (replace this comment block.)
This will help people understand your PR.
Additionally:
 - Bug fixes must be submitted against the lowest branch where they apply
   (lowest branches are regularly merged to upper ones so they get the fixes too).
 - Features and deprecations must be submitted against the master branch.
